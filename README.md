# Programming Plays Celeste
It's like a Celeste TAS, except all the inputs are controlled by Python (the giant omniscient snake).

This repository has been HEAVILY based on the CelesteTAS-EverestInterop repository: https://github.com/EverestAPI/CelesteTAS-EverestInterop

The only difference is that there's less code, and this is generally designed to work on all PC platforms (hopefully, anyways).
