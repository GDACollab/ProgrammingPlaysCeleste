# Programming Plays Celeste
It's like a Celeste TAS, except all the inputs are controlled by Python (the giant omniscient snake).

This repository has been HEAVILY based on the CelesteTAS-EverestInterop repository: https://github.com/EverestAPI/CelesteTAS-EverestInterop

Right now, this is only designed to work with the Forsaken City level, but you're welcome to try it on other levels. The process for getting started is somewhat in-depth, so please check out [the wiki](https://github.com/GDACollab/ProgrammingPlaysCeleste/wiki) for detailed guides on usage.
